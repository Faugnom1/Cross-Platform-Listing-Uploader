Allows users to upload and post content to multiple platforms, including Cloudinary, Facebook, Reddit, and Etsy (in production), with more to be available soon. Users can select the platforms they want to post to, upload images to Cloudinary, write content for Facebook and Reddit, and choose a subreddit for Reddit posts. Currently, only marketplace subreddits are available, but any subreddit can easily be added. The site includes checkboxes for selecting platforms and fields for entering platform-specific information. The main feature is the ability to simultaneously post content to multiple platforms, simplifying the process of content distribution across different social media and online platforms.
